Over the last year, I've found myself referring to my engineering principles quite regularly. I thought it would be worth writing them down my top 10 here.  This is going to be an evolving list of my engineering principles. 

*****
## Define the Problem first 

To identify a good solution, you must first be clear about the problem it is meant to solve. 
Working on a solution without a problem can introduce complexity with little or no value.
For best results, start with the business/user problems. 

*****

## Hypothesis-driven development 

By having a clearly defined problem statement, we can provide possible solutions in the form of a hypothesis that can be tested. By working in small increments we should be able to validate our hypothesis early to avoid wasted effort. (Fail fast)

*****
## Keep it simple 

Work in small simple increments, Take the smallest, simplist step possible so that you can learn something before taking the next step. What is the smallest step/s we can take to validate this hypothesis?

*****

## Tight Feedback Loops

Work closely with designers, optimise for tight feedback loops and short iteration cycles. The sooner you can get real users testing your solutions the better. 

Understand this happens at multiple levels,  you have multiple loops in play at any time.  Keep them tight and fast.


*****
## Justify complexity 

As engineers we trade in complexity everyday. It's not always possible to avoid complexity but we can minise it by insisting any complexity introduced has to demonstrate it will add more user/business value. This is a great way to keep unnecessary tech/requirements away from your code. [Be boring](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-boring-front-end-developer/). 

*****

## Remove assumptions 

Assumptions hide complexity - The best way to remove assumptions is to break a task down into smaller units of delivery and make sure you have clear acceptance criteria for every task. Keep breaking it down till there are no assumptions of concern. 

*****
## Embrace the unknown 

This might seems to be at odds with removing assumptions but it's closely connected. By Acknowledging what we don't know we remove assumptions from the process. We can then dedicate time to understanding and solving those problems in isolation.

*****
## Last responsible moment

Technology changes at a relentless pace,  be it the external landscape or your internal stack. And then there are changes to requirements.   On big projects, it’s often tempting to do some work upfront to figure out the best solution.  The reality is that this is best done as close to the real work being done to ensure the solutions are relevant.



## Integrate continuously 

To operate at scale, it’s necessary to separate concerns and have clear boundaries so people work independently, the risk is the pieces built-in isolation won't work in unison.  You can mitigate this risk by always combining the different pieces as often as possible.

*****

## Continuous improvement   

As engineers, we never stop learning which means there is always room for improvement.  Actively seek it out and challenging assumptions around the status quo. It's important that engineers feel empowered to bring about change.

I will try to keep this list up to date, did I miss anything obvious? What are your engineering principles?
